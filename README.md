# ML2 Final Project

## Purpose
This is a final project for a Machine Learning 2 course at University of Warsaw. It's main purpose was to create a neural network able to recognize whether a skin change is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non cancerous).
For now there is only one model but in the future the plan is to create a couple of different ones and test them. I'm also going to try and download a ready model and use it for classification

## File Description

### Archive

This is the folder containing all the training and test data. It contains raw jpg files showing different skin changes, both malignant and bening. The training data is 2600 pictures and testing data is 660 pictures. 

### Model 1  

This model contains multiple convolutional and some fully connected layers. It's final accuracy was around 83%. It utilizes Adam optimizer, learning rate schedule and early stopping
