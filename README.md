# ML2 Final Project

## Purpose
This is a final project for a Machine Learning 2 course at University of Warsaw. It's main purpose was to create a neural network able to recognize whether a skin change is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non cancerous).
For now there is only one model but in the future the plan is to create a couple of different ones and test them. I'm also going to try and download a ready model and use it for classification
